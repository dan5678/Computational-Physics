# Computational Physics
This repository covers essential topics and techniques in computational physics, focusing on numerical methods to solve complex physics problems. Key subjects include function minimization, ordinary differential equations, integration methods (such as Monte Carlo and symbolic calculation), and the classification and solution of partial differential equations with physical significance. The course bridges the gap between theoretical and experimental physics, integrating computational methods to model and analyze real-world physical systems.

## Project Overview
This project is built using Python, a versatile programming language widely used in scientific computing for its readability and extensive library support. Python's robust ecosystem is especially helpful for computational physics, where efficient numerical operations, complex calculations, and data visualization are key.

### Key Libraries
#### NumPy
Essential for numerical operations and data manipulation. NumPy provides array structures and mathematical functions that are optimized for performance, making it easier to handle large datasets and perform linear algebra computations, which are foundational in physics simulations.

#### SciPy
Extends NumPy's capabilities with more specialized tools for scientific and technical computing. SciPy includes modules for optimization, integration, interpolation, and differential equations essential for modeling complex physical phenomena and solving advanced mathematical problems.

#### Matplotlib
Used for creating detailed and customizable visualizations. In this project, Matplotlib helps generate graphs, charts, and potentially 3D plots to visualize simulation results and data insights, making it easier to interpret computational outcomes in a clear, visual format.
